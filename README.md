### Twenty

Twenty is a mobile app that allows you to quickly and easily connect with professionals in your area.

Log in with LinkedIn to get started.  You'll see a stack of potential connections and simply swipe right to connect or swipe left to move on to the next one.  If both people swipe right, you'll get a notification and can immediately start chatting using our in-app messenger.
