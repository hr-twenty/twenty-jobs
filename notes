group based
  -groups where my groups has most likes to
  -groups where my past likes belongs to
  -other member of my groups

pull profiles from those skill groups
  use weighting formula to assign a score 

weighting formula 
  generated using past accept for a particular cluster
  the goal is a formula that gives a high weight sum for accepted
  weight is the importance of having/not having an attribute

questions:
- fixed group vs fixed clusters vs dynamic clusters
- manually weighted connection between groups/clusters
- where to inject stochastic behavior
- how often to perform each operation, caching, performance considerations
- separate python server or integrate into main node server

- how to get random results, 
  randomizing both cluster and profile score, 
  without too much performance loss compared to a clear cut off
    -modifying cluster score with profile score means essentially getting all users
